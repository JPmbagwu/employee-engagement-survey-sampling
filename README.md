# Employee Engagement Survey 2026: Sampling Strategy

## Project Overview
Developed a statistically sound sampling strategy for the company's 2026 Employee Engagement Survey. The goal was to select a representative subset of employees for surveying, balancing cost, response quality, and actionable insights—without needing to survey everyone.

## Challenge
The organization had a large, diverse employee population (across departments, locations, tenure, etc.). A full census survey would have been expensive, time-consuming, and risked low response rates due to survey fatigue. We needed a method that ensured proportional representation while maintaining statistical confidence.

## What I Did
- Analyzed the full employee population dataset to understand key demographics and subgroups (e.g., department, job level, region, years of service).
- Evaluated sampling options (simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling) and recommended **stratified sampling** to ensure proportional representation across critical segments.
- Calculated optimal sample sizes using statistical formulas, targeting a 95% confidence level and acceptable margin of error.
- Outlined implementation steps, including how to pull the sample, handle non-responses, and weight results if needed.
- Documented everything in a professional report with clear rationale, methodology, risks/mitigations, and recommendations.
- Used [Excel / Python / R] for calculations and visualizations—happy to share anonymized code snippets.

## Impact
- Reduced the survey population from ~full headcount to a manageable sample (e.g., 30–50% fewer invites), lowering costs and administrative burden while preserving data quality.
- Ensured diverse employee voices were represented, leading to more reliable insights into engagement drivers across the organization.
- Enabled HR and leadership to identify targeted improvement areas, which informed initiatives that ultimately boosted employee satisfaction, retention, and productivity.
- Improved survey response rates and data accuracy compared to previous years (or vs. a census approach), giving stakeholders higher confidence in the results.

## Skills & Tools

- Statistical analysis and confidence intervals
- Data segmentation and population analysis
- Clear technical communication (report writing)
- Tools: Excel, [Python pandas/statsmodels], PowerPoint for visuals
